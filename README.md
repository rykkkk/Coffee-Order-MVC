Spring Boot MVC | jdbc | sql | might not work unless local 


this worked once upon a time... common error when running for first time is data.sql file resets and appears empty. must create a line of data in the table for it to run. :(
10/10 when first created. i hope everything stays in the upload here [Assignment1.pdf](https://github.com/rykkkk/Coffee-Order-MVC/files/9702334/Assignment1.pdf)
